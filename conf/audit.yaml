# Audit logger backend, implementing the AuditLogger interface
#
# Out of the box, ecAudit provides the following logger backends
# - com.ericsson.bss.cassandra.ecaudit.logger.Slf4jAuditLogger
# - com.ericsson.bss.cassandra.ecaudit.logger.ChronicleAuditLogger
#
# Slf4jAuditLogger: Configure you logback.xml to specify location of log files and rotation policy. The following
# optional parameters are accepted:
# - log_format   - Format of the audit record sent to SLF4J. Fields can be configured with bash-style parameter
#                  substitution. Supported parameters are ${CLIENT_IP}, ${USER}, ${BATCH_ID}, ${STATUS}, ${OPERATION},
#                  and ${TIMESTAMP}.
# - time_format  - Format of ${TIMESTAMP} field as defined by the Java DateTimeFormatter. By default this field will be
#                  unformatted and get printed as milliseconds since epoch of 1970-01-01Z.
# - time_zone    - Time zone of formatted ${TIMESTAMP}, using system default if unspecified.
#
# ChronicleAuditLogger: Make sure to start Cassandra with the '-da:net.openhft...' option. The following parameters are
# accepted:
# - log_dir      - The directory where binary log files will be stored. This parameter is mandatory for the Chronicle
#                  logger.
# - roll_cycle   - Frequency of log file roll cycle. Supported values are MINUTELY, HOURLY, and DAILY. Default is
#                  HOURLY.
# - max_log_size - Rotate oldest file when maximum size (in bytes) of log files is reached. Default is 16GB.
