# Configuration file for ecAudit
# This configuration file will be automatically picked up by ecAudit if it is placed in the Cassandra configuration
# directory.


# The authorizer backend where the AuditAuthorizer delegate authorization requests.
#
# The value must represent a class name implementing the IAuthorizer interface. This can be any of the backends provided
# out of the box by Cassandra, or your own custom implementation. Cassandra comes with the following authorizer
# implementations:
# - org.apache.cassandra.auth.AllowAllAuthorizer allows any action to any user - set it to disable authorization.
# - org.apache.cassandra.auth.CassandraAuthorizer stores permissions in system_auth.role_permissions table.
#
# By default ecAudit will delegate to the CassandraAuthorizer.
#
wrapped_authorizer: org.apache.cassandra.auth.CassandraAuthorizer


# Role/User whitelist at node level
# This whitelist is only considered if the Java property 'ecaudit.filter_type' is set to YAML or YAML_AND_ROLE
# When enabled, log entries will not be generated for queries performed by roles listed here.
# Authentication attempts will still be logged.
#
#whitelist:
#    - username1
#    - username2


# log_timing_strategy - specify WHEN ecAudit should write log entries. The two options are:
#
# pre_logging  -> Will log an ATTEMPT before passing the operation to the QueryProcessor.
#                 In the event of failure a matching FAILED message will also be logged.
#                 This is the default value.
#
# post_logging -> One message will always be logged after the operation has completed. That message will indicate
#                 whether operation SUCCEEDED or FAILED. This is how logging is implemented in C* 4.0.
#
log_timing_strategy: pre_logging


# Audit logger backend, implementing the AuditLogger interface
#
# Out of the box, ecAudit provides the following logger backends
# - com.ericsson.bss.cassandra.ecaudit.logger.Slf4jAuditLogger
# - com.ericsson.bss.cassandra.ecaudit.logger.ChronicleAuditLogger
#
# By default ecAudit will use the Slf4jAuditLogger.
#
# Slf4jAuditLogger: Configure you logback.xml to specify location of log files and rotation policy. The following
# optional parameters are accepted:
# - log_format   - Format of the audit record sent to SLF4J. Fields can be configured with bash-style parameter
#                  substitution. Supported parameters are ${CLIENT_IP}, ${CLIENT_PORT}, ${COORDINATOR_IP}, ${USER},
#                  ${BATCH_ID}, ${STATUS}, ${OPERATION}, ${OPERATION_NAKED}, and ${TIMESTAMP}.
# - time_format  - Format of ${TIMESTAMP} field as defined by the Java DateTimeFormatter. By default this field will be
#                  unformatted and get printed as milliseconds since epoch of 1970-01-01Z.
# - time_zone    - Time zone of formatted ${TIMESTAMP}, using system default if unspecified.
#
# ChronicleAuditLogger: Make sure to start Cassandra with the '-da:net.openhft...' option. The following parameters are
# accepted:
# - log_dir      - The directory where binary log files will be stored. This parameter is mandatory for the Chronicle
#                  logger.
# - roll_cycle   - Frequency of log file roll cycle. Supported values are MINUTELY, HOURLY, and DAILY. Default is
#                  HOURLY.
# - max_log_size - Rotate oldest file when maximum size (in bytes) of log files is reached. Default is 16GB.
# - fields       - The fields that will be written to the binary log file. Supported fields are CLIENT_IP, CLIENT_PORT,
#                  COORDINATOR_IP, USER, BATCH_ID, STATUS, OPERATION, OPERATION_NAKED, and TIMESTAMP.
#                  Default is CLIENT_IP, CLIENT_PORT, COORDINATOR_IP, USER, BATCH_ID, STATUS, OPERATION and TIMESTAMP
#                  fields.
#

# The column suppressor determines how column values should be logged for prepared statements (i.e. bound values).
# The suppressor is applied to all prepared statements regardless of which table is used.
#
# - ShowAllSuppressor           -> Will not suppress. Prints all values for prepared statements.
#
# - HideAllSuppressor           -> Will suppress all values by replacing the values with its type, e.g. <int>, <text>
#
# - HideBlobsSuppressor         -> Will suppress all blob values. Values will be replaced by a "<blob>"-tag in the log.
#                                  Collection types containing blobs will also be replaced, e.g. "<list<blob>>".
#                                  This suppressor can be useful since blobs can be very big and perhaps not that useful
#                                  to log.
#
# - PartitionKeysOnlySuppressor -> Will only print values for the partition key(s) in prepared statements. Other columns
#                                  will be suppressed. This suppressor can be useful to avoid logging sensitive or less
#                                  useful information.
#
# - PrimaryKeysOnlySuppressor   -> Similar to partition_keys_only above, but here only the primary keys (partition keys
#                                  and clustering keys) are printed.
#
# Note - The suppressor only impacts to the log message if the OPERATION field is logged (see log_format above).
# If OPERATION_NAKED is selected then no bound values will be logged.
#
# A custom column suppressor can be plugged in by setting the full name of an suppressor class implementing the
# ColumnSuppressor interface.
#
# By default the ShowAllSuppressor will be used.
#
column_suppressor: ShowAllSuppressor
