# The audit.yaml Reference

By default ecAudit will look for the ```audit.yaml``` file in the Cassandra configuration directory.
The path to the configuration file can be overridden with the ```com.ericsson.bss.cassandra.ecaudit.config``` Java property.

There is a [sample](../conf/audit.yaml) in the repository which can be used as reference.
It contain default values and comments to get you started.
