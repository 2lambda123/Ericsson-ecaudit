# Contribute

Since there are different flavours of ecAudit for different Cassandra versions,
new patch sets should be created on the oldest maintained release branch.
Once incorporated on the release branch the patch set will be merged forward
on to more resent release branches (if any) and then finally into the master branch.

This way feature compatibility will be maintained on the different flavours of ecAudit.
